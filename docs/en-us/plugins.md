  # Custom Plugins


  While Hands for Bots provides a solid foundation with its core plugins, its true power lies in its extensibility. This section will guide you through the world of custom plugins, empowering you to craft unique conversational experiences tailored to your web applications.


  ## When to Create a Plugin


  - **Interactive Experiences:** If you need a plugin to actively participate in the conversation, accessing messages, analyzing history, or influencing the chatbot's behavior, creating a custom plugin is the way to go. The provided `GUIDed` plugin is an excellent example of this, as it uses user input to guide them through a tutorial.

  - **Specialized Functionality:** When you require functionality that goes beyond the scope of the core plugins, such as integrating with a third-party API, handling complex UI elements, or implementing advanced input/output methods, a custom plugin is necessary.


  ## Plugin Development Guide


  Refer to the [Development](./development.md) guide for detailed instructions on how to structure your custom plugins, including naming conventions, directory structure, and basic code examples.
